  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/images/
    # - assets/graphics/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
fonts:
  - family: NotoSansEthiopic
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansEthiopic/NotoSansEthiopic-Light.ttf
        weight: 300
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansEthiopic/NotoSansEthiopic-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansEthiopic/NotoSansEthiopic-Medium.ttf
        weight: 500
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansEthiopic/NotoSansEthiopic-SemiBold.ttf
        weight: 600
      - asset: assets/fonts/NotoSansEthiopic/NotoSansEthiopic-Bold.ttf
        weight: 700
